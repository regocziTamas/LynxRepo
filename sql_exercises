SQL 1:
SELECT customers.gender, avg(duration) FROM (SELECT caller_id, duration FROM calls UNION SELECT callee_id, duration FROM calls) as call
JOIN customers ON (call.caller_id = customers.id) GROUP BY gender
SQL 2:
O(n*m) where n is the number of records in the parents table and m is the number of
records in the children table. First it runs through the parents table, finds all the records
which match the criteria, and then does the same with the children table.
A count variable should be kept up-to-date while going through the children table.
Concatenation is a constant time process, so there should be no considerable difference between
the two queries.
